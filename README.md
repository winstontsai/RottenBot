# RottenBot
A [bot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots) to help edit [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) data on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) and the [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

## Description
Many film articles on Wikipedia contain Rotten Tomatoes data for the film. For some examples, visit [Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)), [Black Widow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Widow_(2021_film)), and [Casablanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)). RottenBot keeps this info up to date with the help of Wikidata.

There is no consensus on the wording of Rotten Tomatoes prose on Wikipedia, so a bot which rewrites every article's Rotten Tomatoes prose into a uniform format would likely not obtain community approval. Hence RottenBot keeps most of the original [wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext) intact.

RottenBot also has a simple flagging system to prevent undesirable or otherwise overzealous edits from being made. Flagged edits need to be reviewed and cleared by the bot operator in order for the edit to be uploaded.
