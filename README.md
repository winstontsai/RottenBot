# RottenBot
A [bot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots) to help edit [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) data on the [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

For some example edits, see [example_edits.txt](https://github.com/winstontsai/RottenBot/blob/master/example_edits.txt).

## Description
Many film articles on Wikipedia contain Rotten Tomatoes data for the film. For some examples, visit [Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)), [Black Widow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Widow_(2021_film)), and [Casablanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)). RottenBot keeps the numbers up to date. It also adds missing info like the average rating or the critical consensus, updates/adds citations, and performs other minor fixes.

There is no consensus on the wording of Rotten Tomatoes prose on Wikipedia. In particular, a bot which rewrites all the Rotten Tomatoes prose to follow a single, standard format would likely not meet the approval of the community. Hence RottenBot keeps most the original wording when it can, but makes discretionary modifications. In particular, RottenBot performs a complete rewrite of the original wording if the original prose cannot be safely updated automatically.

RottenBot also has a simple flagging system to try to prevent undesirable or otherwise overzealous edits from being made. Flagged edits need to be reviewed by a human, and the flags cleared, for the edit to be uploaded.
